## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
### What is this for?
This service is primarily designed to increase accessibility to the Bible, followed by easier validation of sermon citations, Bible studies, and anyone looking for more.

### Why not a Bible app?
Accessibility is the foremost concern. I can more easily guarantee that a given user has solid screen reader support for their default messaging app than that of a nuanced graphical interface.

### Doesn't this exist already?
There are dozens of Bible text-messaging services, but seemingly none of any sufficient specificity; While I do appreciate the idea of recieving a text message of "the daily verse", I feel as if the experience is akin to flipping to a random page in the Bible: Better than nothing, but missing intention and context.

### Does AngeLine claim a specific denomination?
AngeLine is ambitiously Protestant in nature.

### Is the service free?
I charge you with nothing but the obligation of your soul: To love your Father in Heaven, to listen to his only begotten Son, and to surrender to the Spirit thereafter.
