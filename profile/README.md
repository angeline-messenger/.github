## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
### What is this for?
This service is primarily designed to increase accessibility to the Bible. It is most applicable when facilitating easier validation of sermon citations, Bible studies, and anyone looking for more.

### Why not a Bible app?
Accessibility is the foremost concern. I can more easily guarantee that a given user has solid screen reader support for their default messaging app than that of a nuanced graphical interface.

### Doesn't this exist already?
There are dozens of Bible text-messaging services, but seemingly none of any sufficient specificity; While I do appreciate the idea of recieving a text message of "the daily verse", I feel as if the experience is akin to flipping to a random page in the Bible: Better than nothing, but missing intention and context.

### Does AngeLine claim a specific denomination?
AngeLine is ambitiously Protestant in nature.

### Is the service free?
I charge you with nothing but the obligation of your soul: To love your Father in Heaven, to listen to his only begotten Son, and to surrender to the Spirit thereafter.
